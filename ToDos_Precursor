HTT Precursor: To Do


:)-Is the current numbering preferred? I might suggest 1.40, 2.22, etc. (good balance between telling the reader where something is, and not being an awful kludge to read)

A- Two notations for slices seems like a bad decision, especially since the two constructions agree for the nerve of a category

W- Many more pictures and examples for simplicial sets section --- sidebar about relation to simplicial complexes --- emphasize that we do not draw degenerate simplices. 

W- In example 13, potentially discuss the notion of "freeness" $\Delta^2$ is the free simplicial set generated by the singleton in degree 2. 

A-sufficiency of simplicial idents: cite Goerss-Jardine 

-Maybe make reference to Lurie's Q_\bullet nerve and realization in the section "constructing simplicial sets from cosimplicial objects"

A-Add citations throughout-- Joyal, Goerss-Jardine, Cisinski, Lurie

-A number of proofs need to be filled out, e.g. prop 40. 

- Lifting Problems: Sidebar about homotopy lifting, Serre fibrations, etc. 

- More generally: in the lifting problems section, connect with stuff from topology that people have likely seen before 

-More examples (and at least one non-example) of compact objects.

-comment on "compact" vs. "small" object

A-State the "Technical lemma of great importance" for more general pushout-product with closed monoidal structure. 

-Clean up model structure on Cat, mention canonicity, discuss model structures on Set, and possibly other examples

-Glossary for model categories. Derived $\infty$-category of a model category, simplicial enrichement, etc. 

-Briefly describe ho(co)limits. Drop a reference to Dugger

-Massively expand discussion of rigidification, Use dugger-spivak necklaces. Find cases which can be treated using rigidification (e.g. lifting problems with triv. cofs.) 

W-CW approximation, and expand CGHaus discussion

-Give examples of classical Grothendieck construction, relate Grothendieck construction to notion of classifying space. (loosely, comment on size issues) 

-At least describe the model structures involved in the Grothendieck construction.

-Throughout the "Simplicial homotopy" chapter, use sidebars to emphasize connection to topology. In particular talk about cellular approximation theorems, and use as justification for "discretizing" the spaces

-Homology
